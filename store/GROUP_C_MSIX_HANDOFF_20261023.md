## 2026-10-23 owner decision: Microsoft Store only, unsigned MSIX, minimum viable submission

The owner explicitly does **not** want to buy a code-signing certificate, sign locally, or distribute outside Microsoft Store. For this product, **signing / PFX / HSM / SignTool / external sideload distribution is OUT OF SCOPE and MUST NOT block preparation**. Microsoft's Store MSIX publishing process supplies the Store certificate after certification. The existing unsigned candidate builder is the selected packaging route; keep all existing application/build scripts intact.

**Minimum path, in order:**
1. Confirm own product's Partner Center reserved listing, Store ID and exact package Identity Name, Publisher, PublisherDisplayName, reserved DisplayName and approved next `A.B.C.0` version. Do not invent values; existing user-confirmed Store IDs are not independently live-verified.
2. Confirm genuine product logos and required localization, correct architecture and EXE payload. Perform source regression, portable EXE Windows real-input/output smoke and UI check. Use only genuinely run logs, not 0-step Actions status.
3. Produce **unsigned x64 MSIX** with existing product-specific builder only when its hard configuration checks pass. Unpack and inspect manifest, embedded EXE/resources and SHA-256. Do not mark candidate ready if package cannot be generated or validated.
4. Prepare minimum truthful Store listing: app name, brief feature description/limitations, actual Windows screenshots, product logo, support contact, privacy policy URL, category, age rating, price/markets and dependency licenses/notices. Privacy claims must reflect tested actual behavior.
5. Have the code owner check the draft package on Partner Center **Packages** page: match identity/version to the intended product, fix hard validation errors, record draft upload result. Upload, submit, certification and publish are distinct; **no certification submission or publication in this work without explicit authorization**.

**Excluded:** purchasing a signing certificate, signing a package, publishing a sideload installer, pretending an unsigned MSIX was successfully installed on a normal machine, and demanding WACK as a substitute for actual Store validation. Windows installation/update/uninstall checks can be done after a Store-signed deliverable is available. Until then, use real EXE smoke, MSIX structure/manifest/contents and Partner Center's package validation as evidence, without claiming unperformed lifecycle tests passed.

# Group C | MSIX candidate handoff | 2026-10-23

**Product:** `-AI-Upload-Guard-AI-`  
**Store ID:** `9PDJ1T5BQ4P1` — OWNER_CONFIRMED_IN_CHAT; NOT_LIVE_VERIFIED_IN_PARTNER_CENTER.  
**Designated source:** `ui/safe-product-upgrade-20261019`, SHA `b1774ace76a37fc44cf5102c3e838eda696c22cb` (verified at branch creation).  
**Isolated work branch:** `codex/store-p1-ai-upload-guard-20261023`.  
**Portable EXE:** `dist/AIUploadGuard.exe` (planned output, NOT confirmed built).  
**Existing MSIX builder:** `store/build-msix.ps1` (unchanged).

## Already prepared
- Isolated work branch based on the exact designated source SHA.
- Added only `.github/workflows/group-c-portable-prerequisite.yml`, which invokes the existing portable EXE builder, then runs the existing Python regressions, verifies the named EXE, records SHA-256 and uploads a short-lived EXE prerequisite artifact on success.
- The workflow does **not** build/sign/upload a Microsoft Store package and does not authorize sales or publication.
- At creation, GitHub Actions returned `failure` with **0 executed steps** and no verified build artifact. This means RUNNER/EXECUTION_UNVERIFIED, not a unit-test failure.

## Hard MSIX gates still requiring independent real evidence
1. Partner Center: confirm this product's Store ID, **Package Identity Name**, Publisher, PublisherDisplayName, Package Family Name and exact reserved display name; do not copy another app's values.
2. Owner-approved `A.B.C.0` MSIX package version and historical version collision check; the builder's `1.0.0.0` default is **not approval**.
3. Product-owned `StoreLogo.png` (50x50), `Square44x44Logo.png` (44x44) and `Square150x150Logo.png` (150x150). No invented/mock assets.
4. Windows Actions regression and portable EXE SHA-256 with **actual runner, steps, logs, exit codes and artifact**; source SHA must match the intended release.
5. Run the existing `store/build-msix.ps1` only with verified exact values, approved EXE and assets, on a clean Windows x64 environment with Windows SDK MakeAppx. Preserve previous artifacts.
6. Unpack and inspect the actual MSIX AppxManifest.xml (Identity Name/Publisher, x64, Version, Properties DisplayName, VisualElements DisplayName, PublisherDisplayName), compare EXE hashes and publish exact MSIX SHA-256. Test portable EXE real data/write and UI separately. Signed MSIX install/update/uninstall is not part of this unsigned-Store candidate task. Check Store upload errors separately. **No upload, certification submission or publication without explicit owner approval.**

## Product-specific constraints
Existing script requires approved identity and logo assets; keep the documented limitations of local pre-upload checking. Evidence for privacy egress and third-party dependencies remains separate.

**Current status:** `MSIX=NOT_CREATED_AND_NOT_VERIFIED`, `WINDOWS_E2E=NOT_VERIFIED`, `WACK=NOT_VERIFIED`, `CERTIFICATION=NOT_AUTHORIZED`, `SALES=HOLD`.

Do not change an existing app source file or existing PowerShell script just to suppress a red check. Work on this branch only, with reviewed changes.
